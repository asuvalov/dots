## Status bar
This collection of scripts can be used to set an informative status bar in any
window manager. Most of them are written on shell so they are programming
language independent. Thanks this it's quite easy to switch between different
window managers or status bars keeping using the same scripts.

As you can notice each script prints a certain emoji besides its data to make
the status bar more readable. Therefore if you want to change status bar style
or just see corresponding characters you should install a font which supports
emojis for example [ttf-symbola][1].
